deliver_basic_content=The deliver action determines how much is delivered to a particular node below you.
deliver_piramid_graph=In the pyramid and graph game format, which you know from each other, it is possible to extend the deliver even more specifically. Here you can indicate who you want to order and also add a comparison to it.\
Son business rule with a comprehensive delivery line looks like this:
edit_button=Edit
error_label=Error message:
info_action_deliver=In a pyramid and graph game format, where you know each other, it is possible to give priority to the facilities below you with regard to the delivery. Son business rule with liver priority looks like this:
info_action_order=The standard action that is for most business rules money is an order. This is the amount you ordered at the parent facility (s).
info_comparison_basic_content=A number of complexities can be used in all forms. One of these complexities is the application of sums in the business rule. It is possible to add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*) and divide (/) in an equation (/). A business rule with sums in it looks like this:
info_comparison_basic_percentage_content=Another complexity that can be applied are percentages. It is possible to take a percentage of a value in a comparison. A business rule with percentages is as follows:
info_comparison_content=The comparison is usually built up by comparing two values. This can be a value in the form of a number, but it can also be a value in the game such as inventory. Comparison is done by placing an operation between two values. This operation can be: is (=), is not (! =), Is higher than (& gt;), is lower than (& lt;), is greater or equal(>=) or is lower or equal(<=). Furthermore, it is also possible to combine several comparisons in a business rule in a comparison. Combining multiple equations is done by adding an 'and' or 'or'. In an 'and' both equations must be true to get a final value. With an 'or', only one of the equations has to be true to get a final commodity. Son combined equation looks like this:
info_comparison_linear_content=In a line game format, where you know each other, it is possible to make the business rule more complex by looking at the game value of another facility. Son business rule with game values ??of another facility looks like this:
info_comparison_piramid_content=In a pyramid and graph game format, which you know from each other, it is possible to make the business rule more complex by looking at the game values ??of all facilities above or below your facility. Business rule with game values ??of the facilities above or below lying below you looks like this:
info_comparison_tab_basic=Basic
info_comparison_tab_linear=Linear
info_comparison_tab_piramid_graph=Piramid & graph
info_default_content=A standard 'Default rule' is always true. If there are no 'If rules', then this 'Default rule' is executed. It is possible to have only one 'Default rule' for order and one 'Default rule' for deliver.\
It is also mandatory to set a 'Default rule' for order. This so that as soon as there is no 'If-rules' where there is still an action is carried out.
info_if_content=An 'If rule' is broadly structured from if 'comparison' then 'action'. As soon as a comparison is true, the action is carried out. Are there multiple business rules that are true? Then the agent himself chooses one of the business rules. The 'comparison' and 'action' consist of a number of parts. By combining these parts you create a business rule yourself. A simple business rule looks like this:
info_if_then_content=The if and then are always in the same place in the rule. An if starts the equation and then the action begins.
info_tab_action=Action
info_tab_comparison=Comparison
more_info_button=More info
order_basic_content=The standard action that is for most business rules money is an order. This is the amount you ordered at the parent facility (s).\
Son business rule with a standard order looks like this:
order_piramid_graph=In the pyramid and graph game format, which you know from each other, it is possible to expand the order even more specifically. Here you can indicate who you want to order and also add a comparison to it.\
